Duel Commands
-------------

NAME: Recover
EFFECT: Use 3 evades to gain health in a duel.
LEARNED: Fight in 5 duels and learn from an officer or Huang Cheng Yan.
RATING: Probably the worst duel skill.  Evades are more useful for, well,
evading powerful attacks.

NAME: Shout
EFFECT: Use 3 slices to gain musou in a duel.
LEARNED: Fight in 15 duels and learn from an officer or Huang Cheng Yan.
RATING: Pretty decent, but only because it trumps all other duel skills.

NAME: Scare
EFFECT: Use 3 slashes to gain musuo and deplete your opponent's in a duel.
LEARNED: Fight in 30 duels and learn from an officer or Huang Cheng Yan.
RATING: Slightly better than shout.

NAME: Crush
EFFECT: Use three stabs to hit your opponent pretty hard.
LEARNED: Win 10 duels and learn from another officer or Huang Cheng Yan.
RATING: Pretty good, but gets trumped by any other duel special besides
the generic skills.

NAME: Maul
EFFECT: Use 3 strikes to inflict a ton of damage on your opponent.
LEARNED: Win 30 duels and learn from another officer or Huang Cheng Yan.
RATING: Better than Crush, but still trumped by almost anything.

NAME: Parry
EFFECT: Use 3 swings to counter your opponent's attacks for a round.
LEARNED: Win 10 duels in a row and learn from another officer or Huang 
Cheng Yan.
RATING: The second best duel skill.  Trumps everying besides the shout and
scare tactics, and will destroy someone that uses maul or crush on you.

NAME: Counter
EFFECT: Use 3 swipes to strongly counter your opponent's attacks for a 
round.
LEARNED: Win 30 duels in a row and learn from another officer or Huang
Cheng Yan.
RATING: The best duel skill, but a hard one to learn.  Will mutilate 
anyone that thinks about using any attack special on you.

Debate Skills
-------------

NAME: Awe
EFFECT: Damages the enemy in a debate every turn it is on the board.
LEARNED: Take place in 15 debates and learn it from another officer.
RATING: A pretty decent debate skill, especially if you know your opponent
is likely to use incite, since even if he uses it and you won't be able to
act, you will still be doing some damage while you wait.

NAME: Plead
EFFECT: Prevents the enemy from using an attack command in a debate when
held in your hand.  If you use it as a regular command it will disarm
your opponent's plead/refute cards.
LEARNED: Win 10 debates and learn it from another officer.
RATING: Also good, especially if your opponent has a lot of attack 
commands.

NAME: Fault
EFFECT: An attack command that trumps all regular commands.
LEARNED: Take place in 5 debates and learn it from another officer.
RATING: Relatively useful, but hardly the best command in debates.

NAME: Argue
EFFECT: A stronger version of fault.
LEARNED: Take place in 30 debates and learn it from another officer.
RATING: Slightly better than fault.

NAME: Refute
EFFECT: Counters an enemy's attack command in a debate when held in your
hand.  Disarms the enemy's refute commands when used as a regular card.
LEARNED: Win 30 debates and learn it from another officer.
RATING: If it isn't the best debate skill, it is pretty close.  If your
opponent uses a very strong attack skill and you're holding this card
you will likely defeat him immediately.

NAME: Incite
EFFECT: Trumps argue/fault and makes your opponent inactive for 2 turns.
LEARNED: Win 10 debates and learn it from another officer.
RATING: Among the best debate skills, unless of course your opponent has
a refute card.  Generally with 2 free hits on your opponent you can do
some serious damage.

NAME: Taunt
EFFECT: Trumps every other command, makes your opponent inactive for 2
turns, and inflicts strong damage in a debate.
LEARNED: Win 30 straight debates (no easy task) and then defeat either 
Zuo Ci or Mi Heng in a debate (also not easy). Zuo Ci frequents the Ba-
Shu area, while Mi Heng tends to stick to the Qingzhou area.
RATING: The only card that comes close to matching it is refute, and 
that's because refute could potentially turn an opponent's taunt right
back on them.  Generally, one use of this bad boy will mean disaster for
your opponent, unless they refute it in your face.
